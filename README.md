# Dockerized Meme Studio

The last days I found the [Meme Studio](https://github.com/viclafouch/meme-studio) application from @viclafouch and I wanted a self-hosted version of it.
Since I use only container images for my self-hosted services, this repository automatically builds one for me.

## Usage

//TBD

## Thanks

* @viclafouch for the really nice Meme Studio
